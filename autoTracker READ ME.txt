AutoTrackerV2 - Read Me




NOTE: autoTrackerV2 is known to have compatibility issues with MATLAB 2015a. 
Editing the GUI or script in 2015a in any way will cause the GUI to crash when 
opened.A known work around is to first save the GUI in an older version of 
MATLAB and then re-open the file in MATLAB 2015a.




Getting started with autoTracker

1. If you don't have it installed already, start by installing Git Bash. This 
will allow you to clone the most up to date version of autoTracker and will allow 
you to branch your own version of autoTracker for customization. Download and 
install Git at "https://git-scm.com/downloads". Default installation settings are 
fine.

2. Open the Git Bash command terminal. Start by initiating your user name and email
with the following two commands:

	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email your@address.here

3. Now create a folder for autoTracker in windows explorer. I recommend installing 
it in the MATLAB directory under:

	C:\\Users\\yourCompUserName\\Documents\\MATLAB\\autoTrackerV2

4. Change the Git Bash working directory to the newly created folder with the command:

	cd  C:/Users/yourCompUserName/Documents/MATLAB/autoTrackerV2

5. Initialize a new local Git repository in the folder with the command:

	git init

6. Now clone the remote autoTrackerV2 Git repository by running:

	git clone https://github.com/winsl0w/autoTrackerV2.git

7. The latest version of autoTrackerV2 files should now be in the folder you created.
Now add the new folder to the MATLAB path with the MATLAB path tool.

8. Start autoTracker GUI by executing "autotrackergui" in the MATLAB command line.




Adding a new experiment to autoTracker


1. To add a new experiment to autoTracker, you can create a new script  that can be 
executed in the master script for the GUI, autotrackergui.m.

2. If you would like to implement existing autoTracker features (eg. ROI segregation, 
fast centroid sorting, turn scoring, microcontroller hardware control), you can use 
any of the autoTracker core experiment files or their dependencies as a template:

	autoTrackerv2_ymaze120.m  (best commented)
	autoTrackerv2_ymaze96.m
	autoTrackerv2_arena.m
	autoTrackerv2_led.m

3. Once your your new experiment is created, add the script as an additional case to 
the experiment case switch statement in autotrackergui.m. This will appear under the 
pushbutton2_Callback function (~ line 250).

4. Now add the experiment to the drop-down experiment select menu in the GUI 
(popupmenu3). Open the GUI file by executing "guide" in the MATLAB command line and 
browsing to autotrackergui.fig. Double click on the drop-down menu to edit properties. 
Select the "String" field and add a descriptive entry on a new line. Save the changes.

5. Now the GUI should execute your script when you select the new entry from the 
drop-down menu and select "Run Experiment".
